## Sorting Algorithms

Repository for the Introduction to Computer Science II offered at ICMC - USP, by professor Adenilso Sim√£o.

This repository contains specifically all sorting methods addressed in class:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort (sentinella)
- Insetion Sort
- Merge Sort (recursive)
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
- Quick Sort (recursive)
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort

## Sort from terminal
*command:* **./sort** \[method\] y{0,1} \[vector or vector size\]
- method: selection; bubble; insertion; merge; heap; shell; quick; counting; radix
- y: insert if you with for the sorted vector to be printed
- vector: any number of integers separated by a whitespace
- vector size: if you insert only one integer n, a vector of n integers will be randomnly generated and then sorted
